# Facebook Messenger Summary for Filipinos
Creates summary charts (hourly and daily frequency, frequently talked-to users, and frequently used words) of all Facebook messages. Used specifically for Filipinos, as Filipino stopwords are removed.

Steps to use:
- On Facebook, click on Settings & Privacy > Settings > Your Faceboook Information > Download Your Information
- Under Select File Options, select JSON for Format and Low for Media Quality. Choose a preferred date range. Deselect all activities except for Messages.
- Wait until Facebook notifies you that your data is ready for downloading. This should take less than an hour.
- Download the ZIP file and save the files. Take note of the Messages and Inbox folders, as these will be used in the code.
